    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Principles:**\n",
    "- **Retrieval:** The similarity between a query \\(q\\) and a document \\(d\\) is often computed using cosine similarity:\n",
    "  \\[ S(d, q) = \\frac{d \\cdot q}{\\|d\\| \\|q\\|} \\]\n",
    "- **Generation:** The probability of generating a word \\(w_t\\) given the context \\(C\\) and previous words \\(w_{<t}\\) is modeled as:\n",
    "  \\[ P(w_t | w_{<t}, C) = \\text{softmax}(W_h h_t) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Language Models (LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Principles:**\n",
    "- **Self-Attention:** The self-attention mechanism's computation is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "### LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Concepts:**\n",
    "LangChain, developed as an open-source toolkit, simplifies the creation of applications leveraging LLMs by facilitating integration with external computation and data sources. Its components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema:** Defines core data structures like Text, ChatMessages, Examples, and Document, essential for interacting with language models.\n",
    "- **Models:** Categorizes into Language Models, Chat Models, and Text Embedding Models, offering interfaces for seamless integration with LLMs.\n",
    "- **Prompts:** Crafting prompts is vital for directing LLMs. LangChain introduces PromptTemplates for constructing prompts dynamically.\n",
    "- **Indexes:** Serve as bridges between documents/data and LLMs, crucial for enriching models with context-specific information.\n",
    "- **Memory:** Facilitates storing and retrieving chat history or conversational context, enhancing the model's ability to produce coherent and context-aware responses.\n",
    "- **Chains:** Enable the sequencing of multiple components, such as data retrieval, prompt generation, and response parsing, into a cohesive workflow.\n",
    "- **Agents:** Utilize LLMs for selecting and sequencing actions, embodying the decision-making prowess of LLMs in application scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Innovations in LangChain:**\n",
    "LangChain's modular abstractions for these components significantly lower the barrier to integrating complex LLM functionalities into applications. By abstracting the complexities involved in handling language models, data retrieval, and processing, LangChain empowers developers to build more sophisticated, context-aware applications with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Extensions:**\n",
    "While LangChain primarily focuses on the architectural and integration aspects of using LLMs, the underlying mathematical principles of its components (especially Models and Indexes) are grounded in the computations of neural networks, vector space models, and embeddings. For instance, the Text Embedding Models convert textual data into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space, which can be mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Embedding}(text) = V \\]\n",
    "where \\(V\\) is a vector representing the text in a semantic vector space.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Principles:**\n",
    "- **Tree Construction:** Annoy uses random projection trees for partitioning data, optimizing for both speed and memory efficiency.\n",
    "- **Approximate Search:** The search in Annoy is approximated to quickly retrieve near neighbors without exhaustive search, significantly reducing query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive overview, enriched with details from the LangChain components guide and mathematical principles, offers a deeper understanding of the technologies and methodologies driving today's AI applications. LangChain, by abstracting the complexity of integrating LLMs with external data and computational resources, stands out as a pivotal framework for developers aiming to leverage the power of language models in their applications."

    "\n",
    "Annoy is a C++ library with Python bindings designed to efficiently search for points in space that are close to a given query point, emphasizing speed and minimal memory usage while accepting a trade-off in precision. It's particularly useful for implementing recommendation systems, enhancing search engines, and facilitating various machine learning applications where quick nearest neighbor queries are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Memory-efficient Indexing:** Annoy creates large, read-only, file-based data structures that are memory-mapped, allowing multiple processes to share the same data without duplicating it in memory.\n",
    "- **Incremental Updates:** It supports adding items to the index incrementally without the need to rebuild the index from scratch, making it suitable for dynamic datasets.\n",
    "- **Persistence:** Annoy indexes can be saved to disk and later reloaded, facilitating persistent storage and retrieval of vector data across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in This Notebook:\n",
    "In the context of this notebook, Annoy is utilized to store and query embeddings of retail product descriptions. Here's how we integrate Annoy for a practical use-case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Storage:** We generate embeddings for each product description using a mock function that simulates the conversion of textual descriptions into 100-dimensional vectors. These embeddings are stored in an Annoy index.\n",
    "2. **Index Creation:** An AnnoyIndex instance is created with the specified vector length and metric ('angular' for cosine similarity). Each product's embedding vector is added to the index, which is then built with a specified number of trees to optimize query performance.\n",
    "3. **Querying:** For a given query, its embedding is calculated and used to fetch the nearest neighbors from the Annoy index. This process efficiently identifies the most relevant product descriptions based on the similarity of their embeddings to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showcases the use of Annoy as a vector database for embedding-based retrieval, illustrating its application in scenarios where finding similar items quickly is crucial, such as in retail product recommendation systems.\n"

    "3. **Context Assembly:** The retrieved product descriptions are concatenated to form a context string. This assembled context is then used to inform the generation process, ensuring that the generated text is relevant to the specifics of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Generation with LangChain and H&M:** The concatenated context is fed into a generative model from the `transformers` library, specifically `distilgpt2`, alongside the original query. This generative step uses the context to produce a response that is not only contextually aware but also creatively enriched by the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HTML Presentation:** The query, retrieved context, and generated response are presented in an HTML format for enhanced readability. This step demonstrates how the integration of these technologies can be used to create user-friendly outputs for applications such as product recommendation systems or automated customer service responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "In our example, we query for \"Looking for stylish and comfortable shoes.\" The process involves embedding the query, retrieving related product descriptions using Annoy, and generating a response that synthesizes the query intent with the retrieved information. The final output is displayed in a styled HTML block, making it easy to visualize the integration's effectiveness in producing relevant and engaging content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration exemplifies a practical application of combining retrieval and generative models to enhance the capabilities of AI-driven systems. By leveraging the specific strengths of Annoy for efficient data retrieval and the generative capabilities of language models like `distilgpt2`, developers can create sophisticated solutions that address complex queries with contextually rich and relevant responses.\n"

    "## Collaborative Query Handling: A Detailed Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Query Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of collaborative query handling involves interpreting user inputs (queries) and transforming them into actionable search intents. This process is critical in retail environments where queries can be vague or highly specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Rewriting and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-shot Classification**: This method leverages pre-trained models for categorizing text without explicit examples for each category. The mathematical foundation relies on the model's ability to understand the semantic similarity between the input query and predefined categories. Given a query \\(q\\), and a set of candidate categories \\(C = \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n\\}\\), the model assigns probabilities \\(P(c|q)\\) for each category, selecting the category with the highest probability as the query's classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Predicted Category} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ P(c|q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Rewriting with Generative Models**: The objective is to refine or expand the user's original query to better match retail products or services. Using a model like GPT-2, the rewritten query \\(q'\\) is generated by maximizing the likelihood of the rewritten query given the original query \\(q\\), formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$q' = \\underset{q'}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\ P(q'|q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Representation of Queries and Products\n",
    "\n",
    "For matching queries to products, converting text to vectors allows for computational handling. The transformation \\(f: \\text{text} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d\\) maps product descriptions and queries into a \\(d\\)-dimensional vector space, facilitating similarity comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Similarity Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Using techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, we can efficiently find products similar to a query vector. Given a query vector \\(q_v\\), the goal is to find product vectors \\(p_v\\) that are closest to \\(q_v\\) based on a distance metric \\(D(q_v, p_v)\\). Annoy is a popular library for this purpose, employing trees to facilitate fast and approximate searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation of ANN\n",
    "\n",
    "ANN leverages tree structures to partition the vector space, allowing for faster queries than exhaustive search. The efficiency comes from limiting the search space to regions of the vector space likely to contain the nearest neighbors. For a given query vector \\(q_v\\), Annoy builds a set of binary trees where each node represents a hyperplane that splits the space into two. The search algorithm traverses these trees, prioritizing paths that lead to closer matches based on the chosen distance metric, typically Euclidean (\\(L_2\\)) or Angular distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In a retail environment, collaborative filtering can be used alongside these techniques to recommend products based on the preferences of similar users. This involves matrix factorization techniques or neural networks to predict user preferences for products they haven't interacted with, based on the observed interactions of a larger user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Query Handling in a retail environment involves sophisticated techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and information retrieval. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs for query rewriting and classification, vector space models for product matching, and ANN for efficient similarity search, retailers can significantly enhance the relevance and personalization of product recommendations, leading to improved customer satisfaction and engagement.\n"

    "### Integrating Zero-Shot Classification for Product Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the notebook demonstrates how to leverage the `transformers` library to classify user queries into product categories using a zero-shot classification approach and match these queries with relevant products based on their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "- Initialization: We start by initializing the zero-shot classification pipeline using the facebook/bart-large-mnli model from the Hugging Face transformers library. This model is well-suited for tasks requiring understanding of natural language text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Descriptions Parsing: The product descriptions are parsed to extract categories explicitly mentioned at the end of each description. This information is restructured into a list of dictionaries, each containing the product description and its category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User Queries Classification: User queries are classified into the extracted categories using the zero-shot classification model. This step assigns the most probable category to each query based on the model's understanding of the query and the description of product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching Queries with Products: Based on the predicted categories, user queries are matched with products that fall into the same category. This allows for a dynamic and context-aware recommendation of products corresponding to user interests.\n"

    "## Query Processing and Clarification - Enhancing Retail Product Matching with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore a comprehensive approach to refining retail product searches using advanced AI techniques. Our methodology involves three primary steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Rewriting**: We begin by enhancing user queries for clarity and precision. This step leverages the `distilgpt2` model, known for its effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually enriched text. By rewriting queries, we aim to capture the user's intent more accurately, facilitating a more refined search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Category Classification**: Once rewritten, queries undergo classification using the zero-shot learning capabilities of the `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model. This step is crucial for understanding the category of products the user is interested in, without requiring explicit prior training on our specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Product Matching**: With the query categorized, we proceed to match it against our curated product descriptions. This involves filtering products that fall into the predicted category and presenting them in an organized manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this process is displayed using `pandas`, ensuring that the results are not only accurate but also visually appealing. This approach not only streamlines the search experience but also significantly enhances the relevance of product matches, directly contributing to a more satisfying user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation outlines the strategy and execution of improving retail search mechanisms through AI, embodying the intersection of natural language processing and user-centric design."
