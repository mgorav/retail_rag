# Smart Retail Navigator: Unifying RAG, LLM, and Annoy for Advanced Query Intelligence

## Introduction

The Smart Retail Navigator project leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to redefine how retail data is analyzed and utilized. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLM), and Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) with LangChain, we aim to create a powerful tool for extracting insights and predicting trends in the retail sector.

## Sections Overview
