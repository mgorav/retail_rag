    "### LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Concepts:**\n",
    "LangChain, developed as an open-source toolkit, simplifies the creation of applications leveraging LLMs by facilitating integration with external computation and data sources. Its components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema:** Defines core data structures like Text, ChatMessages, Examples, and Document, essential for interacting with language models.\n",
    "- **Models:** Categorizes into Language Models, Chat Models, and Text Embedding Models, offering interfaces for seamless integration with LLMs.\n",
    "- **Prompts:** Crafting prompts is vital for directing LLMs. LangChain introduces PromptTemplates for constructing prompts dynamically.\n",
    "- **Indexes:** Serve as bridges between documents/data and LLMs, crucial for enriching models with context-specific information.\n",
    "- **Memory:** Facilitates storing and retrieving chat history or conversational context, enhancing the model's ability to produce coherent and context-aware responses.\n",
    "- **Chains:** Enable the sequencing of multiple components, such as data retrieval, prompt generation, and response parsing, into a cohesive workflow.\n",
    "- **Agents:** Utilize LLMs for selecting and sequencing actions, embodying the decision-making prowess of LLMs in application scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Innovations in LangChain:**\n",
    "LangChain's modular abstractions for these components significantly lower the barrier to integrating complex LLM functionalities into applications. By abstracting the complexities involved in handling language models, data retrieval, and processing, LangChain empowers developers to build more sophisticated, context-aware applications with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Extensions:**\n",
    "While LangChain primarily focuses on the architectural and integration aspects of using LLMs, the underlying mathematical principles of its components (especially Models and Indexes) are grounded in the computations of neural networks, vector space models, and embeddings. For instance, the Text Embedding Models convert textual data into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space, which can be mathematically represented as:\n",

    "- **Approximate Search:** The search in Annoy is approximated to quickly retrieve near neighbors without exhaustive search, significantly reducing query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive overview, enriched with details from the LangChain components guide and mathematical principles, offers a deeper understanding of the technologies and methodologies driving today's AI applications.

    "## Mock Data Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python function `generate_retail_mock_data` is designed to create mock retail product descriptions. It's a versatile tool for generating a dataset that could be used in various retail or e-commerce data analysis, machine learning models, or simply for testing and demonstration purposes. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this function works and its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Definition and Parameters\n",
    "- **Function Name:** `generate_retail_mock_data`\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `categories`: A list of strings representing product categories. Default categories are 'shoes', 'apparel', and 'jackets'.\n",
    "  - `num_items_per_category`: An integer that defines how many items to generate per category. The default is 5000.\n",
    "  - `seed`: An integer used to initialize the random number generator. This ensures that the function generates the same sequence of descriptions each time it runs with the same seed value. The default is 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functionality\n",
    "1. **Setting the Random Seed:** By setting the random seed using `random.seed(seed)`, the function ensures reproducibility. This means that every time the function is called with the same seed, it will produce the same set of mock product descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generating Product Descriptions:** The function iterates over each category provided in the `categories` list. For each category, it generates `num_items_per_category` product descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Description Format:** Each product description is formatted as a string that includes:\n",
    "   - The category name, capitalized.\n",
    "   - A sequential number (1 to `num_items_per_category` for each category) to uniquely identify each item within its category.\n",
    "   - A combination of three randomly selected features from the list `['lightweight', 'durable', 'waterproof', 'stylish', 'comfortable']`. This randomness in feature selection adds variety to the mock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appending Descriptions:** Each generated description is appended to the `product_descriptions` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- The function returns the `product_descriptions` list, containing all the generated descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "The last line of the provided code prints the first five product descriptions from the generated mock data. Here's what an example output might look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Shoes 1 with features: durable stylish comfortable in category shoes.\n",
    "Shoes 2 with features: lightweight waterproof durable in category shoes.\n",
    "Shoes 3 with features: comfortable stylish waterproof in category shoes.\n",
    "Shoes 4 with features: durable waterproof stylish in category shoes.\n",
    "Shoes 5 with features: lightweight comfortable stylish in category shoes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "This mock data generation function can be particularly useful in scenarios where real product data is unavailable for testing, such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "This section of the notebook demonstrates how to utilize the Annoy library to create an efficient nearest neighbor search index. Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point, particularly useful for very high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure that Annoy is installed in your environment. You can do this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install annoy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by importing the necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from annoy import AnnoyIndex\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Annoy Index\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Length Specification:** Define the dimensionality of the vectors that will be indexed. In this case, `vector_length = 100` implies that each product description is represented as a 100-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vector_length = 100  # Assuming a 100-dimensional vector for each product description\n",
    "annoy_index = AnnoyIndex(vector_length, 'angular')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choosing the Metric:** The `'angular'` metric is used here, suitable for comparing the similarity between vectors. This metric is particularly useful for normalized vectors and can be replaced with `'euclidean'`, `'manhattan'`, `'hamming'`, or `'dot'` based on the specific requirements of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting Descriptions to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A mock function `description_to_vector` is defined to convert product descriptions into numerical vectors. This function uses a simple random generation strategy for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with a more sophisticated method, such as using pre-trained text embedding models (e.g., word2vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def description_to_vector(description):\n",
    "    np.random.seed(hash(description) % (2**32 - 1))\n",
    "    return np.random.rand(vector_length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Populating the Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Each product description is converted into a vector using the `description_to_vector` function, and then added to the Annoy index. The `add_item` method takes two arguments: an ID (integer) for the item and the item's vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, description in enumerate(mock_retail_product_descriptions):\n",
    "    vec = description_to_vector(description)\n",
    "    annoy_index.add_item(i, vec)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The `build` method finalizes the index, making it ready for querying. The argument specifies the number of trees to be constructed in the index. More trees increase the precision of the search at the cost of more memory and longer build time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "annoy_index.build(10)  # Using 10 trees\n",
    "print(\"Annoy index is built with\", num_products, \"items.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup creates an Annoy index for efficiently searching nearest neighbors among high-dimensional product description vectors. Annoy offers a balance between speed and accuracy, making it an excellent choice for applications requiring fast nearest neighbor searches in large datasets."

    "\n",
    "Annoy is a C++ library with Python bindings designed to efficiently search for points in space that are close to a given query point, emphasizing speed and minimal memory usage while accepting a trade-off in precision. It's particularly useful for implementing recommendation systems, enhancing search engines, and facilitating various machine learning applications where quick nearest neighbor queries are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Memory-efficient Indexing:** Annoy creates large, read-only, file-based data structures that are memory-mapped, allowing multiple processes to share the same data without duplicating it in memory.\n",
    "- **Incremental Updates:** It supports adding items to the index incrementally without the need to rebuild the index from scratch, making it suitable for dynamic datasets.\n",
    "- **Persistence:** Annoy indexes can be saved to disk and later reloaded, facilitating persistent storage and retrieval of vector data across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in This Notebook:\n",
    "In the context of this notebook, Annoy is utilized to store and query embeddings of retail product descriptions. Here's how we integrate Annoy for a practical use-case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Storage:** We generate embeddings for each product description using a mock function that simulates the conversion of textual descriptions into 100-dimensional vectors. These embeddings are stored in an Annoy index.\n",
    "2. **Index Creation:** An AnnoyIndex instance is created with the specified vector length and metric ('angular' for cosine similarity). Each product's embedding vector is added to the index, which is then built with a specified number of trees to optimize query performance.\n",
    "3. **Querying:** For a given query, its embedding is calculated and used to fetch the nearest neighbors from the Annoy index. This process efficiently identifies the most relevant product descriptions based on the similarity of their embeddings to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showcases the use of Annoy as a vector database for embedding-based retrieval, illustrating its application in scenarios where finding similar items quickly is crucial, such as in retail product recommendation systems.\n"

    "## Integration of LangChain with RAG and Annoy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we explore the integration of LangChain with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Annoy, showcasing a seamless workflow that combines the retrieval capabilities of Annoy with the generative prowess of a Large Language Model (LLM) provided by Hugging Face's `transformers`. This integration exemplifies how to leverage the strengths of both retrieval and generation to enhance the relevance and richness of generated text based on a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Overview:\n",
    "1. **Query Embedding:** For a given query, we first convert it into an embedding vector using a mock function `description_to_vector`. This function simulates the process of transforming textual data into a numerical representation that can be processed by machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval with Annoy:** Using the query's vector representation, we retrieve the nearest neighbor product descriptions from an Annoy index. Annoy efficiently identifies the vectors in the dataset that are closest to the query vector, based on cosine similarity. This step highlights Annoy's utility in quickly fetching relevant data from a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Assembly:** The retrieved product descriptions are concatenated to form a context string. This assembled context is then used to inform the generation process, ensuring that the generated text is relevant to the specifics of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Generation with LangChain and RAG:** The concatenated context is fed into a generative model from the `transformers` library, specifically `distilgpt2`, alongside the original query. This generative step uses the context to produce a response that is not only contextually aware but also creatively enriched by the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HTML Presentation:** The query, retrieved context, and generated response are presented in an HTML format for enhanced readability. This step demonstrates how the integration of these technologies can be used to create user-friendly outputs for applications such as product recommendation systems or automated customer service responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "In our example, we query for \"Looking for stylish and comfortable shoes.\" The process involves embedding the query, retrieving related product descriptions using Annoy, and generating a response that synthesizes the query intent with the retrieved information. The final output is displayed in a styled HTML block, making it easy to visualize the integration's effectiveness in producing relevant and engaging content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration exemplifies a practical application of combining retrieval and generative models to enhance the capabilities of AI-driven systems. By leveraging the specific strengths of Annoy for efficient data retrieval and the generative capabilities of language models like `distilgpt2`, developers can create sophisticated solutions that address complex queries with contextually rich and relevant responses.\n"
