    "\n",
    "Annoy is a C++ library with Python bindings designed to efficiently search for points in space that are close to a given query point, emphasizing speed and minimal memory usage while accepting a trade-off in precision. It's particularly useful for implementing recommendation systems, enhancing search engines, and facilitating various machine learning applications where quick nearest neighbor queries are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Memory-efficient Indexing:** Annoy creates large, read-only, file-based data structures that are memory-mapped, allowing multiple processes to share the same data without duplicating it in memory.\n",
    "- **Incremental Updates:** It supports adding items to the index incrementally without the need to rebuild the index from scratch, making it suitable for dynamic datasets.\n",
    "- **Persistence:** Annoy indexes can be saved to disk and later reloaded, facilitating persistent storage and retrieval of vector data across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in This Notebook:\n",
    "In the context of this notebook, Annoy is utilized to store and query embeddings of retail product descriptions. Here's how we integrate Annoy for a practical use-case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Storage:** We generate embeddings for each product description using a mock function that simulates the conversion of textual descriptions into 100-dimensional vectors. These embeddings are stored in an Annoy index.\n",
    "2. **Index Creation:** An AnnoyIndex instance is created with the specified vector length and metric ('angular' for cosine similarity). Each product's embedding vector is added to the index, which is then built with a specified number of trees to optimize query performance.\n",
    "3. **Querying:** For a given query, its embedding is calculated and used to fetch the nearest neighbors from the Annoy index. This process efficiently identifies the most relevant product descriptions based on the similarity of their embeddings to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showcases the use of Annoy as a vector database for embedding-based retrieval, illustrating its application in scenarios where finding similar items quickly is crucial, such as in retail product recommendation systems.\n"

    "## Integration of LangChain with RAG and Annoy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we explore the integration of LangChain with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Annoy, showcasing a seamless workflow that combines the retrieval capabilities of Annoy with the generative prowess of a Large Language Model (LLM) provided by Hugging Face's `transformers`. This integration exemplifies how to leverage the strengths of both retrieval and generation to enhance the relevance and richness of generated text based on a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Overview:\n",
    "1. **Query Embedding:** For a given query, we first convert it into an embedding vector using a mock function `description_to_vector`. This function simulates the process of transforming textual data into a numerical representation that can be processed by machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval with Annoy:** Using the query's vector representation, we retrieve the nearest neighbor product descriptions from an Annoy index. Annoy efficiently identifies the vectors in the dataset that are closest to the query vector, based on cosine similarity. This step highlights Annoy's utility in quickly fetching relevant data from a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Assembly:** The retrieved product descriptions are concatenated to form a context string. This assembled context is then used to inform the generation process, ensuring that the generated text is relevant to the specifics of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Generation with LangChain and RAG:** The concatenated context is fed into a generative model from the `transformers` library, specifically `distilgpt2`, alongside the original query. This generative step uses the context to produce a response that is not only contextually aware but also creatively enriched by the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HTML Presentation:** The query, retrieved context, and generated response are presented in an HTML format for enhanced readability. This step demonstrates how the integration of these technologies can be used to create user-friendly outputs for applications such as product recommendation systems or automated customer service responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "In our example, we query for \"Looking for stylish and comfortable shoes.\" The process involves embedding the query, retrieving related product descriptions using Annoy, and generating a response that synthesizes the query intent with the retrieved information. The final output is displayed in a styled HTML block, making it easy to visualize the integration's effectiveness in producing relevant and engaging content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration exemplifies a practical application of combining retrieval and generative models to enhance the capabilities of AI-driven systems. By leveraging the specific strengths of Annoy for efficient data retrieval and the generative capabilities of language models like `distilgpt2`, developers can create sophisticated solutions that address complex queries with contextually rich and relevant responses.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **User Query:** Initiates the process, where users enter their queries regarding retail products, starting the interaction flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain Framework:** Serves as the central orchestrator, efficiently managing the workflow from user query input to fetching nearest neighbors via Annoy and generating responses through LLM. It ensures seamless integration and communication between different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annoy Index:** A critical component that stores pre-processed vector embeddings of product descriptions, enabling quick and efficient retrieval of items similar to the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieve Nearest Neighbors:** This step is crucial for identifying contextually relevant product descriptions based on the user's query, which are then utilized to inform the response generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Hugging Face):** At this stage, the system leverages a pre-trained language model to generate detailed and contextually enriched responses by incorporating both the original query and the context provided by the nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate Response:** The synthesis of input and retrieved context through the LLM culminates in the generation of a response tailored to the user's query, embodying the integration of RAG principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Display Results:** The final step where the system presents the generated response back to the user, completing the cycle and providing a cohesive answer to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlighted Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rapid Context Retrieval:** Utilizes Annoy for the swift retrieval of relevant context, significantly speeding up the response generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalable System Design:** Engineered to accommodate the extensive and growing datasets typical in retail, ensuring the system's scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular and Flexible:** The architecture's modular design promotes flexibility, allowing for the easy replacement or enhancement of individual components, such as swapping the LLM model or modifying the retrieval strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced User Engagement:** By delivering precise, context-aware responses, the system significantly improves user interaction and satisfaction, showcasing the potential of AI in transforming retail experiences.\n",
